            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS His Majesty by His Proclamation bearing date at <hi>Oxford</hi> the first day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> in the Ninteenth yeare of His Majesties Raigne, did for the reasons therein expressed, order appoynt declare and publish that the Courts of <hi>Chancery,</hi> Receipt of <hi>Exchequor,</hi> &amp; of First <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Tenths,</hi> the Court of the Dutchie of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Court of <hi>Wards</hi> and <hi>Liveries,</hi> and the Court of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> or Court of <hi>Requests</hi> should be held and continued at His Citty of <hi>Oxford</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the whole Terme of <hi>Easter</hi> last past. And His Majesty by His said Proclamation for the ease of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had suites in any the Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench, Common-pleas,</hi> and <hi>Exchequor,</hi> did adjourne part of the said Terme of <hi>Easter</hi> unto the Returne of <hi>Quinque Septimanas Paschae</hi> then next ensuing, And did declare that the two last Returnes called <hi>Quinque Septimanas Paschae</hi> and <hi>Crastino Ascensionis</hi> should be held at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the usuall places where formerly they were held. As by the said Proclamation more at large may appeare.

His Majesty therefore of His especiall favour and Clemency, doth hereby declare that He is pleased, and contented to adjourne part of the said Terme of <hi>Trinity,</hi> that is to say, from the said second day of <hi>Iune,</hi> unto the said Returne of <hi>Quindenae Trinitatis,</hi> And that the two last Returnes called <hi>Quindena Trinitatis,</hi> and <hi>Tres Trinitatis</hi> shall be held at <hi>Westminster</hi> in the usuall places where formerly they were held. All which His Majesty signifieth to all and singular His Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects of this His Realme, to the intent that they, and every of them, who have or shall have any Suite or other occasion to attend any of the said Courts of <hi>Chancery,</hi> Receipt of <hi>Exchequor,</hi> and of first Fruits and Tenths, Dutchie of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> Court of <hi>Wards</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,</hi> and Court of <hi>Requests,</hi> may give their attendance at the said Citty of <hi>Oxford</hi> as aforesaid, and not elsewhere, and that such of them as have or shall have cause, or commandement to appeare in any of His Majesties said Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Exchequor</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> may take notice thereof, and give their attendance accordingly without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt to be incurred towards His Majesty, or any prejudice to themselves in that behalfe.
